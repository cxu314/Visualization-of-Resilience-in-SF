#  Community Resiliency in San Francisco

In this project, we visualized Community Resiliency Scores in different neighborhoods of San Francisco with interactive plots using Plotly and Bokeh. In addition, we designed a website to house the visualizations. We optimized our web page through an A/B test using Google Analytics to increase users engagement.

Codes for main visualizations are in the fold "Code". Libraries we have used include pandas, numpy, json, and bokeh.  
Fold "Data" includes datasets we have used for visualizations and a description document of our main dataset.  
In the fold "Presentation Slides", we have both presentation slides for beta release and final presentation. The final demo is in that fold too.  
The most updated website files are in the fold "Updated Website".
